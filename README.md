## Description:

Parlons is an instant messaging application completed as the capstone project for the 2023-2024 Carleton University academic year. It has a technological stack consisting of React, Node.JS, MySQL, Jest, and the React Testing Library. It was deployed on Netlify (front-end) and Heroku (back-end + database).

Parlons allows users to chat and interact with other existing users in a variety of ways. They can send messages and various forms of media whenever they want. Parlons also allows for customization to the user's liking.

## High-level Schema: 

There are 5 tables in the schema that contain the users, all messages sent, all contacts, all chats, and all participants for each chat. The relations between each table are shown below in the ER diagram.
